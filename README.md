public datasets for testing, benchmarking and comparison

Note: The PDF Supplemental tables provide an annotated list of GEO datasets for disease-specific and KO experiments. These can be processed by the protocol below to generate DE gene sets (see TSV files in subfolders).

## GEO Protocol
1. Go to https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/geo2r/?acc=GSE22873. Replace GEO ID.
2. Expand Samples
3. Define two groups, e.g., cancer/normal or ko/wt
4. Assign samples to groups
5. Click on Top 250
6. Click on Save all results
7. Save as TSV into appropriate subfolder
